		<h1>Kong Rou</h1>
		<img src="https://cicili.tv/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Kong-Rou-Small2.jpeg">
		<p> I’d like to share with you a Taiwanese braised pork belly recipe. It’s called “Kong 			Rou” in mandarin. They are very similar to “Lu Rou”, but there are still some 			differences. And, the pork belly is cut into bigger slices. I remember having this in 			Taiwan, and it was just so hearty and delicious. Let’s get started with my version 			of “Kong Rou”!
		</p>
		<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>2 tablespoons avocado oil</li>
			<li>3 pounds pork belly, with skin, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
			<li>3 slices ginger</li>
			<li>1 bulb shallot, sliced</li>
			<li>6 cloves garlic</li>
			<li>2 stalks scallions, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
			<li>2 1/2 tablespoons sugar</li>
			<li>6 cups water</li>
			<li>6 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
			<li>1 ½ tablespoons dark soy sauce</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons rice wine</li>
			<li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
			<li>2 pods star anise</li>
			<li>8 boiled eggs</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Instructions:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>In a pan over high heat, add the avocado oil (or oil of your choice), and  				the pork 			belly. Pan fry until golden brown, 5 minutes. Remove the pork belly, 				and reserve 2 tablespoons of oil.</li>
			<li>In a pot over medium heat, return the oil, add the ginger, shallot, garlic, and 				scallions. Stir-fry until aromatic, 2 minutes. Also, place in the sugar and 				stir fry until lightly browned, 3 minutes.</li>
			<li>Pour in the water, and turn to high heat. Add the soy sauce, dark soy sauce, 				and rice wine. Place in the cinnamon and star anise. Whisk. Bring it to a 				simmer.</li>
			<li>Turn to low heat, return the pork belly, cover the lid, and simmer for 30 				minutes.</li>
			<li>Uncover the lid, and place in the boiled eggs. Remove the extra oil on top. 				Cover the lid and continue to simmer for another 30 minutes.</li>
		</ol>
